## ⚙️ About

Norm cultura is a design practice focused on branding solutions and working on the intersection between research and intuition, blending the k-hole-esque normcore with fun.

This multi-page next.js app is a design agency portfolio website. Dotted grid and showing element dimensions on hover makes for an unusual and raw look, yet simple and easy to navigate.
